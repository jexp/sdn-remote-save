== Spring Data Neo4j Remoting Performance Tests


Some tests for SDN remoting, running 1000 business operations each which create 9 entities and 8 relationships.

The speed difference is quite impressive:

|===

| Mode | Operations | Time (ms) | Time/Op (ms)
| SDN remote (old):  | 1000 | 282385 | 282
| SDN embedded: | 1000 | 11879 | 11
| SDN remote extension: | 1000 | 11879 | 16
| JDBC Cypher: | 1000 | 5235 | 5
| SDN  Cypher: | 1000 | 7739 | 7
| SDN remote (new):  | 1000 | 38151 | 38

|===

Run each of the tests individually, the remote tests start their own embedded Neo4j test server.
